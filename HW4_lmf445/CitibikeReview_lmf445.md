##IDEA: Older people are less likely to use citibikes than young people.


## a) NULL HYPOTHESIS
### The ratio of people over 45 years old biking on weekends over people biking on weekdays is the same or higher than the ratio of people under 45 years old biking over weekends to people below biking on weekdays

## a)Comments on the  NULL HYPOTHESIS
###I believe the NULL Hypothesis responds to the IDEA: Older people are less likely to use citibikesd during the #### weekend #### than young people.
If I wanted to state a NULL Hypothesis for your IDEA It would be:
##Null Hypothesis: the total rides count of people over 45 years old is equal or greater than the total rides count of people below 45 years old in the month of January 2015.

##The alternative hypothesis is correctly stated for your given Null Hypothesis

## b)The data was correctly proccesed and the columns birth_year and date are enough to answer the question. I would include a dropna to delete the NaN values if they existed.

## c) t-Test

##I would chose t-Test because you are measuring a ratio with a group that has 2 differences(above 45 years old or below 45 years old) and the observations of the 2 groups are paired. The question that you would respond is: Do differences exist between the 2 groups on the DV (the ratio)?
