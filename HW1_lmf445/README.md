# Assignment 1: Finish Lab 1

## Finish the lab started in the first lab session if you have not in class:

###Here you can find myfirstfile.txt that I pushed from my computer to my github repository.
https://github.com/fernandomelchor/gittest_lmf445/blob/master/myfirstfile.txt
### During my work on creation of the first file I experienced some problems when trying to fix the merge conflict at the end I realized I was using "git commit myfirst file" instead of "git commit" without the name of the file. That is why I did the excersise witht he file several time that cna be monitored at the commits record.

##Fork
###For the fork excercise I cloned Sebastian's repo and sent him a Pull Request, even though he already had done it, but he was so kind to redo it to help me, Thnx Sebastian.
###After that I was trying to test solving a merge with Enrique jsut for testing and it went wrong , I am working to solve that one.
