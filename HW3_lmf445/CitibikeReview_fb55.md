# Citibike mini project review by fb55

## IDEA: 
Interesting, novel compared to many idea explored by others in the class, and well formulated.
(if you write in English seg should be sec)

## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
The null is formulated fine in words, but the formulat that follows is says the opposite you want E/N_subscriber >= E/N-costumer!
But you are calling it H_1 and miss the = sign so perhaps you meant to write the formula for the alternative, in which case it is correct. ** but you should have both null and alternative formulated in words and in mathematical formulae**

## data wrangling
EACH FIGURE SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN CAPTION!! and you should show a figure for your final measurements: the ratios (better if with errorbars, at least statistical errors).

You are all set for a test of proportions (e.g. chi sq)
