#HW_3_1
##Discussion to undertand the generation of random numbers for HW#_1 with Sebastian Banos, Jonathan D. Geis and Sofiya Elyukin
##We can see in this homework how the bigger the sample the closet they get to the mean in the case of all distribution.
##At the end we can visualize that the combination of the same means of all the distributions tend to resemble a Gaussian distribution.
